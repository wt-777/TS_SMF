# TS_SMF
This part of the code provides a complete process for the TS-SMF algorithm. It includes: data preprocessing (including the first stretch), second stretch matching, and TS-SMF algorithm phenological detection.

Thereinto:

1. data_process network is the first stretch of data

2. peak_centered_stretch is the second stretch of the data

3. Phenology_detect_processed_dual is the TS-SMF algorithm for phenological detection

4. soy_multiyear_lhy is the example site provided, the time year is 2016 to 2019

5. best_model_Soybean and best_refenrence_curve are the optimal model tested in the experiment and the real phenological period of the site
